In the world today, Cities, especially metropolitan cities, experience overpopulation.
This issue demands the development of solid strategic planning that uses
infrastructure, innovation, and technology to adapt to rapid changes. To address
the mobility issues in cities with the ever-increasing number of vehicles, we propose
a solution that develops a smart parking system. The solution we offer is to
make a plan for various parking areas, grid them out, deploy modules at every
parking spot that consists of Raspberry Pi, sensors that detect if a carâ€™s there or
not and send real-time information to the app, provide a pre-booking system using
the car registration numbers and detect them on entry using cameras. This system
provides for overall better dissipation of knowledge as opposed to the current
method of going to the place and searching for a parking spot.
